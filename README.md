# Liar's dice
Having some fun with real-time webcam feed processing in python by implementing
a game of liar's dice where the user plays their dice on a webcam feed.

## TODO

- Re-check the rules on a bid: is it still valid if it is more that what was last bid?
- Implement players turn. Last round's looser begins next round


## Installation

```
conda create -n liars_dice python=3.11
conda activate liars_dice
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
